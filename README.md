# AeoLiS
AeoLiS is a process-based model for simulating aeolian sediment
transport in situations where supply-limiting factors are important,
like in coastal environments. Supply-limitations currently supported
are soil moisture contents, sediment sorting and armouring, bed slope
effects, air humidity and roughness elements.

AeoLiS is developed and maintained by [Bas
Hoonhout](b.m.hoonhout@tudelft.nl). Documentation can be found at
(http://openearth.github.io/aeolis-python/).

AeoLiS is developed at [Delft University of
Technology](http://www.tudelft.nl) with support from the ERC-Advanced
Grant 291206 Nearshore Monitoring and Modeling
([NEMO](http://nemo.citg.tudelft.nl>)) and
[Deltares](http://www.deltares.nl>).
